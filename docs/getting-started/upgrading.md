# Upgrading

## Upgrading 1.2 to 1.x

### Laravel and PHP versions

Support for Laravel 6.0 was added in Voyager 1.3 and therefore the minimum PHP version is now 7.2.  
Please update your versions accordingly!

### Update your Composer.json

To update to the latest version inside of your composer.json file make sure to update the version of Voyager inside the require declaration inside of your composer.json to:

`tcg/voyager": "1.3.*`

And then run composer update
